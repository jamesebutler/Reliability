<p>A Reliability Failure, either recordable or chronic, is defined as “Certified 
Kill” when 1) the physical, human, and latent roots for the failure have been 
identified, and 2) the corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence have been 
completed. Documentation is required for a failure to receive a “Certified Kill” 
label in the RI database which includes:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Description of the Failure</li>
  <li>Financial Impact of the failure</li>
  <li>Physical, Human, and Latent roots found</li>
  <li>Changes (Action Items) implemented to prevent reoccurrence</li>
  <li>Cost of Remedy</li>
</ul>
<p>A “Certified Kill” label can only be designated by the management team that 
originally initiated P/CF process for resolving the failure. If a reoccurrence 
of the failure occurs, it will be re-label as a Chronic Problem.
